# 🎰 EuroMillions Simulation  

This project simulates EuroMillions draws to analyze potential long-term winnings. It allows you to:  
✔️ Generate draws based on real probabilities.  
✔️ Compare a player's grid with each draw and calculate winnings.  
✔️ Simulate several years of play (e.g., 50 years, or 5200 draws).  
✔️ Analyze net profits using Matplotlib graphs.  

## 📌 Features  

- Random generation of EuroMillions draws.  
- Checking winnings based on the official prize table.  
- Simulation of thousands of games.  
- Display of net profits in a graphical format.  

## 📊 Objective  

Evaluate whether playing regularly is profitable in the long run.  

## 💻 Usage  

```python
player_grid = {3, 15, 22, 37, 48}  # 5 numbers  
player_stars = {4, 11}             # 2 stars  

run_multiple_simulations(player_grid, player_stars, 5200, 1000)
```  

This code simulates 1000 instances of playing EuroMillions for 50 years and saves a graph of net profits.  

## 📎 Dependencies  

- `matplotlib`  
- `numpy`  
- `scipy`
